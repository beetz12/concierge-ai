AI Concierge automates the tedious process of finding and booking local service providers. Orchestrated by Kestra, it leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash to research candidates via Google Maps and deploys concurrent VAPI voice agents to interview them simultaneously about availability and rates. The system analyzes these real-world conversations to present the top three recommendations and handles the final booking, turning hours of phone tag into a seamless, "fire-and-forget" experience.
