Okay, perfect! Now I want to test
  '/Users/dave/Work/concierge-ai/kestra/flows/contact_agent.yaml' and get
  it working. Please first make sure that
  '/Users/dave/Work/concierge-ai/kestra/scripts/call-provider.js' It's
  properly integrated with
  '/Users/dave/Work/concierge-ai/kestra/flows/contact_agent.yaml' and add
  the required API keys to our .env.example file. Also please answer the
  following questions. 1. Since we are relying on the VAPI assistant to do
  the interaction with the customer, How is the VAPI assistant returning
  the results to us after the call so that we can take the next steps? Is
  it a certain output format or is it dynamic? 2. Currently the
  assistantConfig has a hard-coded prompt which only works for that
  specific use case. But our app specifically ask the user certain details
  such as What they need help with and their criteria which are not
  included in the prompt. I am thinking that we need to first build the
  prompt by calling gemini first based on the user's requirements and then
  Pass the new prompt to create the VAPI agent. What do you think? 3.
  currently, when we call /simulate-call, Even though the conversation is
  not real, I really like how our AI agent (Gemini) chats with the user in
  a natural way. is there any way we could reverse engineer or just
  directly use the prompt for this  

We are competing in a hackathon and we are building @docs/about.md. Pleaes analyze our current @"docs/AI Concierge Gameplan.md" and our current
  code state and @docs/hackathon.md and present a comprehensive high level plan for us to achieve our goal and win the hackathon. please Use your
  specialized multi-agent team to analyze these in parallel and once all agents are done, present a unified comprehensive plan with 90% confidence
  that contains all of the tasks that need to be done organized by major categories such as frontend, backend, sponsor APIs, and sorted by
  difficulty level and wait for further instructions. Keep in mind that the hackathon team has 4 members with 1 senior full dev with 17+ years of
  experience and 3 junior devs with 1 year of experience in the MERN stack. I'll tip you $200 if you exceed my expectations.

I just built @about.md but the UI doesn't look very good. The white background in the content makes it look pretty plain. Please first research and identify the best unique palettes and fonts for our specific app to make the UI more visually appealing that we will apply it to our entire app. Also make sure that it is responsive.

# review frontend and backend

I just implemented ____ and ____. Please review both the front-end and back-end code using your multi-agent team in parallel to make sure that they can work properly together, that they follow the same API contract, and that our migrations have all the proper columns. Identifying the issues we need to address in a new plan with 90% confidence. ultrathink

# api contract

Before you start, please define a clear API contract between the front-end and back-end following our existing patterns and make sure that both The front-end and back-end implementations respect our API contract. 

# multiple solutions
Please explore multiple solutions using your team of specialized agents (up to three) and present a solution with the best likelihood of success. ultrathink

# merge issues
Our main branch has changed a lot since this was done. Please pull the latest main branch and make sure that these changes are compatible and fix any issues that come up your team of specialized agents working in parallel. 

# review code
I just implemented ___ Please review the code with your specialized agent team in parallel to make sure
  that everything has been implemented correctly. 
  If you find any issues, please Identify the root cause and fix them with 90% confidence.

# reconcile code
Ok main branch has changed since this pr was created. Please merge the main branch with your code and fix any merge conflicts with 90% confidence using your team of AI agents working in parallel. 

# deep-work
Perfect! Please first save this plan using the @.claude/commands/save.md command and then 
please implement it using @.claude/commands/deep-work.md using your specialized agents in parallel and don't stop until fully complete. 
If you encounter any critical conflicts or significant obstacles, Present to me the options and ask me what to do instead of Making blind assumptions. My mortgage payment depends on this and If you get this right on the first try, I will tip you $200. ultrathink  

# no-deep-work
Perfect. Please implement this using your specialized agent team working in parallel with up to 3 agents at a time.


# confidence
Only implement when you have 90% confidence and ask me questions and do web research for 2025 to get to that confidence.

# code-review

I just implemented '/Users/dave/Work/nex-photos/docs/features/SUPPORT_SYSTEM_PROGRESS.md'. 
Please help me do a full code review with your specialized ai team to make sure
that the front-end, back-end, and database are all properly set up and can work together and fix any issues you find. If you encounter any critical conflicts or significant obstacles, Present to me the options and ask me what to do instead of Making blind assumptions and proceeding.  ultrathink

# update skill

Please find the appropriate claude code skill in '/Users/dave/Work/nex-photos/.claude/skills' or create a new skill Following our existing skill patterns to include the insights and discovery we just gained - to ensuer that future agents will be able to quickly and properly diagnose and fix this issue.

Perfect. Please implement this using the nextjs expert agent for frontend and
nodejs agent or fast api agent for the backend - with both agents working in parallel.
