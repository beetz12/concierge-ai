## SECTION 1: HOOK & PROBLEM (0:00-0:20)

**[SCREEN: Fast montage of someone frustrated on phone, clock ticking]**

> **Narrator:** "Finding a plumber shouldn't take three hours of phone calls. You call. You wait. You repeat yourself. Over and over."

**[SCREEN: ConciergeAI logo animation]**

> **Narrator:** "What if an AI could do all of that... in under five minutes? Welcome to ConciergeAI."

---

## SECTION 2: DEMO - Submit Request (0:20-0:45)

**[SCREEN: `/new` page - form being filled]**

> **Narrator:** "Here's John. He needs a carpenter in Greenville, South Carolina to build a custom cabinet. He fills out a simple form..."

**[SCREEN: Highlight Google Places autocomplete capturing address]**

> **Narrator:** "Notice how we capture his REAL address using Google Places. This matters - when providers ask 'where's the client?', our AI gives them the actual location."

**[SCREEN: Click "Start Research & Booking" button]**

> **Narrator:** "One click. That's all John does."

**[SCREEN: Status changes to "Researching..." - providers appear on right panel]**

> **Narrator:** "Instantly, Gemini AI with Google Maps grounding searches for qualified carpenters. In thirty seconds, we have ten candidates."

## SECTION 3: CUT SCENE - Phone Rings (0:45-1:15)

**[CUT TO: Your phone ringing on a table - "ConciergeAI" calling]**

> **Narrator:** "But here's where it gets magical. The AI doesn't just search - it CALLS."

**[CUT TO: You answer the phone]**

> **AI Voice (from phone):** "Hi there! This is John's personal AI assistant calling to check on carpentry services. Do you have a quick moment?"

**[CUT TO: You responding as provider]**

> **You (as provider):** "Yeah, sure, what do you need?"

> **AI Voice:** "John needs a custom cabinet built within two days. Are you available?"

> **You:** "We can come out tomorrow afternoon."

> **AI Voice:** "What's your typical rate for custom cabinet work?"

> **You:** "It's eighty-five dollars for the consultation, then we quote the project."

> **AI Voice:** "Perfect! I'll share this with John. If he'd like to proceed, we'll call you back to schedule. Thank you so much!"

**[CUT TO: Phone showing "Call Ended"]**

> **Narrator:** "Real phone calls. Real conversations. No simulation."

---

## SECTION 4: DEMO - Results & Recommendations (1:15-1:45)

**[SCREEN: Back to web app - calls completing in real-time]**

> **Narrator:** "While that was happening, the AI was calling FIVE providers at the same time."

**[SCREEN: Highlight transcript panel with multiple completed calls]**

> **Narrator:** "Every call captured. Every response recorded. Full transcripts available."

**[SCREEN: Status changes to "Analyzing..." then recommendations appear]**

> **Narrator:** "Now Gemini analyzes all conversations - scoring each provider on availability, rates, and how well they meet John's criteria."

**[SCREEN: Top 3 recommendation cards with scores and AI reasoning]**

> **Narrator:** "The result? Three personalized recommendations with AI-powered reasoning. John clicks 'Select' - our AI calls back to book. Done."

---

## SECTION 5: SPONSOR SHOWCASE - About Page (1:45-2:15)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to `/about` page]**

> **Narrator:** "Let me show you the technology that makes this possible."

**[SCREEN: Scroll to "How It Works" flow diagram]**

> **Narrator:** "This is our agentic architecture - a complete autonomous workflow from research to booking."

**[SCREEN: Scroll to "Powered By" tech stack section]**

> **Narrator:** "Six technologies working together..."

**[SCREEN: Highlight each card with visual emphasis]**

> **Narrator:**
> - "**Kestra** - our orchestration brain, coordinating every step with built-in AI Agents"
> - "**VAPI** - powering realistic voice calls with ElevenLabs"
> - "**Gemini** - our AI with Google Maps grounding"
> - "**Vercel** - deployed live, globally accessible right now"
> - "**Supabase** - real-time database powering live updates"
> - "**CodeRabbit** - keeping our code clean on every pull request"

## SECTION 6: SPONSOR DEEP-DIVE (2:15-2:45)

### Kestra (Wakanda Data Award Focus)

**[SCREEN: Show Kestra dashboard or workflow YAML]**

> **Narrator:** "Let me highlight Kestra specifically. It's not just orchestrating tasks - we're using Kestra's **built-in AI Agent** to summarize data from Google Maps..."

**[SCREEN: Highlight `io.kestra.plugin.ai.agent.AIAgent` in YAML]**

> **Narrator:** "...and critically, to MAKE DECISIONS based on that data. The AI Agent analyzes provider information and decides which ones to call."

### Cline CLI (Infinity Build Award Focus)

**[SCREEN: Show terminal with `scripts/cline/` directory]**

> **Narrator:** "We also built a complete developer toolkit on top of **Cline CLI**."

**[SCREEN: Show security-review.sh running]**

> **Narrator:** "Security scanning, automated testing, Kestra workflow validation - all built ON TOP of the CLI to improve our development workflow."

### CodeRabbit (Captain Code Award Focus)

**[SCREEN: Show GitHub PR with CodeRabbit comments]**

> **Narrator:** "And CodeRabbit reviews every pull request - you can see the comments right here in our repo."

## Production Notes

### Phone Footage Requirements

You need to film:
1. **Your phone ringing** - with "ConciergeAI" or similar caller ID displayed
2. **You answering as a provider** - natural conversation with the AI
3. **Call ending naturally** - AI says goodbye and hangs up

**Tips:**
- Film in good lighting with phone clearly visible
- Have a friend call you, or screen record a real VAPI test call
- Show your genuine reaction - authenticity wins

### Screen Recording Requirements

1. `/new` page - filling the form
2. `/request/[id]` page - watching progress in real-time
3. `/about` page - scrolling through tech stack
4. Kestra dashboard or YAML files
5. GitHub PR with CodeRabbit comments
6. Terminal showing Cline scripts

### Visual Emphasis Suggestions

| Moment | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Google Places autocomplete | Zoom/highlight |
| Providers appearing | Animation/pop |
| Phone ringing cut scene | Full screen transition |
| AI voice speaking | Audio wave visualization overlay |
| Recommendation cards | Zoom on score |
| Each sponsor tool | Logo fly-in |

### Audio

- **Background music:** Upbeat, modern, tech-forward (royalty-free)
- **AI voice:** Your actual VAPI Rachel voice from the call
- **Narrator:** Clear, confident, conversational pace
