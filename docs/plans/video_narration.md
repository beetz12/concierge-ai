**(0:00 - 0:07)**
**(Upbeat, modern music begins)**
**Narrator:** Finding and booking local services is a headache. You spend hours researching, making calls, and repeating yourself. What if an AI could do it all for you in minutes? Welcome to ConciergeAI.

**(0:08 - 0:17)**
**Narrator:** Let’s see it in action. Our user, John, needs a carpenter to build a custom cabinet. He simply fills out a quick form, telling the AI his name, the service he needs, and his address, which is accurately captured using Google Places.

**(0:18 - 0:27)**
**Narrator:** He specifies his urgency—within two days—and sets a minimum quality standard of 4.5 stars. After adding a brief description and his phone number for notifications, he clicks "Start Research & Booking."

**(0:28 - 0:38)**
**Narrator:** Immediately, the AI gets to work. In this first stage, it uses Gemini and Google Maps to research and qualify over ten local carpenters in Greenville who meet John's specific criteria.

**(0:39 - 0:50)**
**Narrator:** In under 30 seconds, the research is complete, and the top 10 candidates appear on the right. Now, the magic begins. The AI initiates concurrent calls, contacting multiple providers at the same time.

**(0:51 - 1:05)**
**Narrator:** Using a hyper-realistic voice, our AI assistant interviews each provider. It asks about their availability for a custom cabinet project, inquires about their rates, and confirms they can meet John's timeline.

**(1:06 - 1:45)**
**Narrator:** You can see the progress in real-time. As calls are completed, the status updates instantly. What would normally take John hours of frustrating phone tag is happening automatically in just a few minutes.

**(1:46 - 2:45)**
**Narrator:** The calling phase is now complete. The system has successfully gathered all the necessary information without John lifting a finger.

**(2:46 - 3:20)**
**Narrator:** Let's look at the results. For every call, a full transcript and an AI-generated summary are available. For the first provider, the call ended before gathering key details.

**(3:21 - 3:36)**
**Narrator:** But for Forest Kitchen Design, the AI had a successful conversation, confirming they can come for a consultation tomorrow, detailing their trip fee, and even getting an estimated project timeline.

**(3:37 - 3:55)**
**Narrator:** Next, Gemini analyzes all the successful conversations. It scores each qualified provider against John's original criteria—like urgency, quality, and specific needs—to generate the top 3 recommendations.

**(3:56 - 4:04)**
**(Music swells slightly)**
**Narrator:** In just a moment, John will receive a text message with these top 3 providers, complete with scores and AI-powered reasoning. He can select his choice with a single reply, and our AI will call them back to book the appointment.

**(Outro)**
**Narrator:** From a simple request to a confirmed booking in under five minutes. That’s ConciergeAI. We give you back your time.
