I want to build an AI receptionist / secretary that can help me research various local service providers and book appointments with them. I will submit what I need help with, such as "I have a leaking toilet that I need fixed ASAP. I'm in Greenville SC, and I want a reputable licensed local plumber with at least 4.7 rating and can arrive in the next 2 days." The app will first search for a list of qualified people in my area, and then it will call the plumbers one-by-one on my behalf to find their rates, availability, etc to see if they meet my criteria. And once it finds the right provider, it will schedule the appointment with them and send me a text / email to complete the task. It should keep a history of all my requests that I can review later that includes the steps it performs such as research, its analysis, how each interaction went, and the provider it selected and the reason. It should also include a feature where I can simply enter the contact information of a service provider, and enter what I need help with - such as scheduling an appointment or checking the price and and the AI agent will call the provider on my behalf to complete the desired objective.
