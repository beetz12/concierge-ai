# ConciergeAI: The AI Agent That Makes Real Phone Calls For You 📞

Finding a plumber or dentist shouldn't take 3 hours of phone tag. Meet **ConciergeAI**—the intelligent assistant that researchs, calls, interviews, and books local service providers for you in under 5 minutes.

Watch as we deploy 5 concurrent AI Voice Agents to ring up real businesses, negotiate rates, and secure an appointment—all while we sit back and watch.

### 🛠️ BUILT WITH (Hackathon Sponsors)

We built this for the **AI Agents Assemble Hackathon** using a powerful modern stack:

*   **Kestra (Orchestration):** The brain of our operation. We use Kestra's **AI Agent** to summarize research data and make autonomous decisions on which providers to recommend.
*   **VAPI.ai (Voice AI):** Powers the realistic phone calls using ElevenLabs voices and Deepgram transcription with ultra-low latency.
*   **Google Gemini 2.5:** Provides the intelligence for research (Maps grounding), conversation analysis, and decision making.
*   **Vercel:** Hosts our Next.js 16 application with lightning-fast global deployment.
*   **CodeRabbit:** Used for automated AI code reviews on every pull request to ensure security and quality.
*   **Cline CLI:** We built custom security and testing tools ON TOP of the Cline CLI to automate our dev workflow.
