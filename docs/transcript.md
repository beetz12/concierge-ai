Hi there. I'm Dave's personal AI assistant. Dave is hoping to speak with a financial adviser because he's having some difficult affording his mortgage payments right now. Do you have a quick moment? Great. Thank you.

User
Yes.

AI
Dave's located in Greenville SC, and he's looking for some help within the next 2 days. I was hoping you could answer a few questions for me. First, what's your earliest available consultation for a new client?

User
In 2 weeks.

AI
Okay. So 2 weeks out for the earliest consultation. Got it. My next question is, what would the cost be for an initial consultation regarding mortgage affordability or financial plan?

User
90 dollars per hour.

AI
Okay. So it's 90 dollars an hour for the consultation. Does Horizon's wealth match offer specific services or strategies to help clients struggling with mortgage payments.

User
I will help him come up with a plan. And at the end, will give him the plan.

AI
Okay. So you'll help him come up with a plan and then provide him with that plan. Can you describe your typical approach or a general strategy for assisting clients with managing their housing related financial challenges?

User
I will have him list all of his costs and then reduce them and see if he needs to file bankruptcy.

AI
Thank you so much for your time. Have a wonderful day.
